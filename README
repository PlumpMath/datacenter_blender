This is a project by Ludvig Rhodin for CSCI4830 Datacenter Scale Computing.

The purpose of the project was to quickly build a datacenter scale cloud rendering framework for Blender3D.

A webserver is used as the master server to hold project files and finished renders. You can upload projects, request renders, and dowload the renders RESTfully from here.

Many rendernodes can be launched and will automatically connect back to the webserver to recieve render requests.

To test the system:
Source openstack credentials.
Launch the webserver using startweb.sh
Launch a rendernode using startnode.sh
Upload the test project using 'upload.sh untitled.zip'
Render the project using 'render.sh untitled 1 10'
Download a sample image using 'image.sh untitled 1'

These test scripts can be used as baselines to make more complicated requests.
