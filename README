This is a project by Ludvig Rhodin for CSCI4830 Datacenter Scale Computing.

The purpose of the project was to quickly build a datacenter scale cloud rendering framework for Blender3D.

A webserver is used as the master server to hold project files and finished renders. You can upload projects, request renders, and dowload the renders RESTfully from here.

Many rendernodes can be launched and will automatically connect back to the webserver to recieve render requests.

NOTE: To test the system, you must first manually make an ssh connection from the first render node to the webserver. Once this is done, replace the included ssh/known_hosts file with the /home/rhodin/.ssh/known_hosts file from that rendernode. WITHOUT THIS REMOTE CONNECTIONS WILL FAIL.

To test the system:
Launch the webserver using startweb.sh
Launch a rendernode using startnode.sh
Upload the test project using 'upload.sh untitled.zip'
Render the project using 'render.sh untitled 1 10'
Download a sample image using 'image.sh untitled 1'

These test scripts can be used as baselines to make more complicated requests.
